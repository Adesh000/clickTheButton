### Topics Learned :
- Get Element By Id
- innerText

### Technologies Used :
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Description:
This program shows you how many times you clicked the button.
`HTML` and `CSS` was already written for this program. I just wrote `script` of this program, I declared a variable `i` and assign it with `0`. After that I declared a function `increase()` and inside function I used increment operator to increase the value of `i` and then I used `getElementById` method and `innerText` to change the text inside the `span` element. So what happens, Whenever you clicks the button it calls the `increase()` function everytime and value of `i` increases everytime and it updates the text of `span` tag with current value of `i`.
